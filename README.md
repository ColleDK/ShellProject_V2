# Shell Command #
This program is the 2nd iteration of my shell which will use system calls instead of hardcoded functions from https://github.com/ColleDK/ShellProject

### How to Download ### 
1. Download the zip-file and extract it
2. Open your terminal and change the directory to the extracted location ( extractedLocation/ShellProject/ )
3. Compile the main file with gcc shellProject.c (if you want specified name do gcc -o _name_ shellProject.c)
4. Run the compiled version with ./a.out (or if you have specified a name do ./name)

### Implemented features ###
##### This shell will take the following inputs as arguments #####
### ls ###  
Ls will output the content of a directory to the terminal. The arguments that is implemented in this program is: ls (-_letter_) (/_DirName_) (| grep _grepWord_)   
Everything inside the parenthesis is optional and can be combined together.

### cd ### 
Cd will change your directory into a specified one if it exists.   
The arguments implemented in this program is: cd (~) (_DirName_) (_/fullPath_)   
Everything inside the parenthesis is optional and if its only cd then you will go to the home directory.   
None of these can be combined.

### clear ###
Clear will clear the terminal window.

### pwd ###
Pwd will output the current working directory to the terminal.

### mkdir ###
Mkdir will create a new directory in the current working directory if it doesnt already exist.  
Mkdir will take a single argument _dirName_ which will be the name of the new directory.
 
### rmdir ###
Rmdir will delete an existing directory in the current working directory.  
Rmdir will take a single argument _dirName_ which will be the name of the directory that needs to be removed.

### grep ###
Grep will output the content of a file to the terminal where grepWord is present.   
The implemented arguments for grep is: grep _grepWord_ _fileName_

### cat ###
Cat will output the content of a file to the terminal.   
The arguments implemented in this program is: cat _fileName_ ( | grep _grepWord_ )    
Everything inside the parenthesis is optional.   

### exit ###
Exit will close down the program

## How it's implemented ##
This program uses a UNIX system's system calls to run these commands.   
Whenever one of these commands needs to be run I use fork to create a child-process which will create an identical image of the parent-process, that will then execute a command e.g. ls or cat.   
When piping is utilized in the commands the user will run, I need to create an array that will be my read/write pipe. Since the output from the first child-process' execution doesn't need to be output to the user, I use the dup2 call to redirect my I/O to the read/write of the pipe.    
Whenever I run an execution i might need to run some code after the child-process has finished its execution, but **only** after it has finished. For example in my pipe i cannot run the grep command before i have run the cat command, therefore i use the system call wait, which will make the program idle for a certain amount of time (i use wait(NULL) to specify i need to wait for the child-process to finish).
